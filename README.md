Welcome to my Python folder. You can find the following projects and the dataset I used in the folder:

1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis - Netflix title:
In this project, I used basic data cleaning techniques such as cleaning null data, changin data type, and then using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to illustrates some exploratory observations on the dataset.

2. Two-sample t-test - Marketing AB:
In this project, I used two-sample t-test to run an A/B statistic test case, to evaluate if a company's new advertising campaign is successful and if the new ad campaign contribute to the increment of conversion rate.

3. Basic Programming - Rock Paper Scissor game:
In this project, I used various basic Python programming techniques such as while loop, if conditions, to create a rock paper scissor game where you can play the game with the computer.
